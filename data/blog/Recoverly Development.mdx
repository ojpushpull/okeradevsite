summary: Starting to build digital properties.

I plan on creating modible apps focused on substance abuse recovery as part of my digital strategy.
I have started with a sober day counter app. Here is the link for my github, https://github.com/ojpushpull/incounter.
In the final version I plan to have a sober quote daily that appears as a notification. 
I will be creating this mobile app using react native. I will be doing a blog post series with solutions
for the problems I encounter on this project.
