Hey guys this is my developer blog. I will be discussing my coding and business projects I am working on.
My projects are going to be focusing on my passions which are substance abuse recovery, trading card games,
and animals. I will discuss a bit about the technology and work that goes into what 
I am developing as well as my thoughts and goals that go into these projects.
I hope that this brings some value to people who are interested.
